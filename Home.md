### Guiding Principles

When you design and implement an interface, please keep in mind that:

1. _"Perfection is reached not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away."_ - Antoine de St. Exupery
2. _"Everything should be as simple as possible, but no simpler."_ - Albert Einstein
